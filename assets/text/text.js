<p>Here’s how it works </p>
<ul>
<li>1. Set a short term goal and make a commitment to yourself -- e.g. I’m going to bike 50 miles in the next week</li>
<li>2. Stake some money on your ability to keep your commitment -- e.g. $10 </li> 
<li>3. Get going -- e .g. get biking! </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you complete your goal, you get your money back. But if you come up short of your goal, you lose your money.</p> `;
